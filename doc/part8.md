I started looking into progressive web apps when submitting abstracts for Kscope18 in Orlando. At that time I didn't realized how powerful they were, or how useful they would be. A few months later, I gave the talk, but you can only explain so much in less than an hour, so it was much less in depth than this repository.

The term _Progressive Web App_ is getting a lot more traction. But is it just just another buzzword? After much research, I can attest that it's not. It's actually a boring term to describe what is it: a series of concepts to progressively enhance your application experience.

That's very important to understand: you do not need to implement all PWAs features at once. Start with one, perhaps an easy one, like in [Part 4: Installing an APEX App into a Mobile Device](./doc/part4.md), then move progressively towards the other features. Eventually, you will get close to a complete PWA, but it should not be goal from the start. Especially with [Part 6: Handling Background Sync](./doc/part6.md), where the methodology requires manual coding of many aspects in an application. Baby steps.

I think we can only get more demand for PWAs in the future, as their features becomes more mainstream in web patterns. I know PWAs have a bright future and I feel very strongly about their adoption in APEX, because I think APEX is a pretty damn good candidate for it.

Writing this guide took a lot more time than I expected. To all of you book writers in the tech community, I raise my glass. But at the end of the day, explaining code in depth is immensely gratifying because the content sinks in much more. I feel much more knowledgeable about progressive web apps now than I was at Kscope18 when I gave the talk.

Anyway if you enjoyed this guide on PWA, please share the word!
